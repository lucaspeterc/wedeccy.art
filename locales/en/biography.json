{"stan_b1":"Artist's Biography","stan_b2":"Stanisław Maria Wedecki was born in 1951 in Bydgoszcz and died in 2008 in Warsaw. He studied graphics at the Academy of Fine Arts and became a master in the poster studio of Prof. Henryk Tomaszewski. He graduated in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in the studio of Prof. Henryk Tchórzewski in Warsaw in 1976. Initially, he designed posters for the National Publishing Agency and the Polish Jazz Federation, while also painting at the same time.","stan_b3":"Before leaving Poland in 1982, Stanisław Maria Wedecki painted very pessimistic themes in rather dark colors (brown, black). After about half a year in Vienna, he moved to Hamburg, where he met his future wife, Helga Wachsmuth-Wedecka, at his exhibition in the gallery. From that point on, he completely changed his painting style. He began to paint in more optimistic colors (greens, blues). His style is defined by art experts as surrealism (magnetic realism). His paintings became increasingly popular throughout Germany. He began presenting his paintings at numerous exhibitions and selling them.\n\n","stan_m1":"Memories of Stanisław as Recounted by His Friends","stan_m10":"A few years later, I was organizing an autumn fashion show for a department store in the city center, and I hired Stasio as a stage designer. The show was held at the Teatr Mały in Warsaw. Staś took me to Łazienki Park and told me to collect leaves. When I expressed my surprise, he explained that it was, after all, an autumn collection, so we would sprinkle the theater boards with yellowed leaves, hang umbrellas, and that would be our scenery. The effect was amazing, as if we were in a real park, and everyone loved it. So simple, yet so effective.","stan_m11":"After moving to a larger studio in Sadyba, we continued our meetings, or rather, lavish parties. Staś was painting more and more at that time, but he still harbored the intention of leaving this communist country. I also remember going with him to a Stevie Wonder concert at the 10th Anniversary Stadium. What an atmosphere. Staś said that this area, before the Second World War, belonged to his father, but some people found that fact bothersome. ","stan_m12":"We met again in Hamburg in 1984Staś invited me and my then-wife to his home, introduced me to his wife, Helga, and we spent many extremely pleasant moments together. Staś showed us around Hamburg. He was even proud to live in this industrial city. We took a boat ride on the Elbe River, and in the evening, he took me to St. Pauli to show me the district of debauchery, something unthinkable in Eastern European countries. ","stan_m13":"It’s difficult to say much more in such a short memoir, but I want to emphasize that he was a very interesting, charming, and immensely talented person. The older I get, the more I \"read\" his magical paintings. It is a great pity that he is no longer with us, and that he will never paint anything more.","stan_m2":"I met Stasio Wedecki at the art center. Somehow, it so happened that we immediately became friends. He had a beautiful collie sheepdog, and we often went for walks with him to Saxon Park (Park Saski). He loved animals, and that was what connected us. We both got into the Academy and studied in the same year throughout our studies. We held house parties and banquets, chased after girls, and drank hectoliters of cheap wine. Our youth was, one might say, artistic and celebratory. In the studio of Prof. Tchórzewski, we painted easel by easel. With us was Krzysiek Płóciennik, our dear friend, and almost every day we stayed after hours.","stan_m3":"That’s when the real painting would begin. We competed, admired each other’s paintings, but it was a fantastic rivalry, devoid of jealousy. Each of us painted differently. We would come and first look at what Krzysiek painted, what Stasiek painted, and what I painted. And we saw: \"Oh boy, he really rocked it, I can’t be worse!\" This was a tremendous boost for us. I loved this competition. Each of us gave his best, and this translated into the quality of our paintings. Then Stasio left, and we lost contact for a few years. I knew he painted a lot, but he didn’t show anything when he visited Warsaw. He visited Poland more and more often, but his art remained inaccessible to us, his friends.\n\n","stan_m4":"We remained friends for the rest of his life. He enjoyed visiting me in Podkowa, and I think he was touched to see my young son. He was very fond of him. It’s interesting because he was never interested in children, he didn’t have any of his own, but the older he got, the more children moved him. When we received news of his death, it seemed impossible, even absurd. After all, he wasn’t old; we were all his age. Then we met his wife, Helga, whom we hadn’t met before. And it was only after Stasio was no longer with us that we finally saw his paintings.\n\n","stan_m5":"It was a striking experience for me. I had never seen anything like it. Nostalgic, surrealistic landscapes. Misty, mysterious sceneries of sadness and reverie. Shapes of the imagination in an aura of loneliness and contemplation. They were amazing paintings. And there was one last unfinished painting. A greenish landscape with a windowsill and the outline of a sort of head—perhaps a ghost. Then I thought of finishing this painting. With Helga’s permission, in place of the ghost, I painted a portrait of Stasio. I am happy that, in this way, I could honor my friend and express my admiration and longing for the years we shared.","stan_m6":"I met Stanisław in art classes, where in those days, young people who wanted to pass the exams to the Academy of Fine Arts would gather. Later, it was a great time—the time of studies at the Academy and the desire to conquer the world. Somewhere in the middle of our studies, we set up our so-called own business and took up screen printing. We printed all sorts of things, not necessarily legal for the authorities of the time. At the end of the 1970s, there was trouble buying the right materials and inks for screen printing. In order to obtain them, I traveled to Austria, and so martial law, imposed on December 13th, found me there. With a large amount of paint, I stayed in Vienna. After some time, Stanisław joined me, and we lived together in the apartment of my late partner, Helena, who was a pianist. The artistic atmosphere of the house, along with meetings with musicians and artists, influenced both me and Stanisław very creatively. During that time, we drew and painted for days. Then Stanisław left for Germany.","stan_m7":"We met again at a vernissage in Warsaw, where Stanisław arrived in the company of two beautiful women—one was his wife, Helga, and the other was his mother, Wanda Wedecka. And then, years later, came that tragic day and the news that Stanisław had disappeared. Thanks to the help of my cousin, Stanisław was found, but unfortunately, he was already dead. I found him in the morgue. Staś was the victim of a reckless driving accident. And so, the fate of a great painter and friend was ended by an idiot who wanted to drive his car like a madman.","stan_m8":"I met Stasio around 1969, during the Woodstock era. We were 18 at the time. Sometimes we would meet at his house, where his mother had a painting studio. We used to invite pretty girls from the art school in the Royal Łazienki Park. I would take pictures (I had already mastered the arcana of photography quite well at the time) in an interesting setting among easels with paintings and antique furniture. The results were fantastic. I remember once almost paying for it with my life when Stasio, hidden in an old chest, attacked me with a saber. Fortunately, it ended with only a slight scratch.\n","stan_m9":"Staś was an extremely charming person. He liked to joke, but he was also very distracted (the typical artist). I recall one time when we met with a few friends at the Europejska café in Zakopane. Each of us ordered something—coffee, Coca-Cola, etc. Staś ordered a cup of tea, threw in a lemon, and then said, \"Fuck, this tastes like dishwater.\" It turned out he had forgotten to add the tea bag. There were many such situations.","wanda_b2":"Wanda Wedecka was born in 1919 in Homel and died in 2011 in Warsaw. Between 1945 and 1951, she studied at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń under the guidance of Tymon Niesiołowski.","wanda_b3":"Wedecka painted compositions with dried flowers, landscapes, still lifes, and nudes, using thick impastos and a dark, subdued colour palette. Her works are found in private collections and museums in Poland and worldwide.","wanda_m1":"Michał Gutt's Memories of Wanda Wedecka","wanda_m2":"I met Mrs. Wanda Wedecka when her son, and my friend, invited me to her home. It was not a traditional house; it was a painting studio where she lived and worked. As a young boy, I was visiting such a place for the first time, and I was both shocked and charmed. Everywhere—flowers in various forms—fresh, dried, painted on canvases. The paintings were on the walls, on easels, leaning against the walls everywhere.","wanda_m3":"At that time, I was engaged in photography semi-professionally, and from the first moment, I wanted to arrange a photographic session in such a place. After a few weeks, I succeeded, but first, I was subjected to a test by Mrs. Wanda. This test consisted of her asking me countless questions, which I had to answer, while Professor Jodłowski, later the dean of the Academy of Fine Arts and Mrs. Wanda’s partner, sat nearby. I recall talking about my travels around the world to make films and photos for press agencies. I felt like I was taking an exam, but it must have gone well because, from that point on, I was free to hang out with her son without restrictions.","wanda_m4":"Mrs. Wanda was a very beautiful woman, extremely refined and elegant. She was also a very pleasant person, always smiling. I think today it was because of all those flowers. She herself was like a beautiful flower, especially visible against the gray backdrop of communist reality. She painted beautiful pictures, applying paint with a spatula, layer upon layer, so that the flowers appeared as if we were all in a botanical garden. As it happened, a few years later, I was collecting a painting and money for another painting sold at a gallery in Stockholm, and I took it all to Hamburg, where her son Stanisław lived and worked.","wanda_m5":"At that time, Mrs. Wanda's paintings were fetching dizzying prices, and one had to wait in line to be able to purchase them. Her works were also exhibited in some galleries and museums. I remember how happy and proud she was when her son introduced her to his wife, Helga. I was invited to her home-studio, where the creative atmosphere prevailed, regardless of how much champagne was consumed for the occasion. The paintings she created now adorn the walls of many homes and apartments on every continent. Wanda has become history.","wanda_m6":"Rafał Dmochowski's Memories of Wanda Wedecka ","wanda_m7":"I met Mrs. Wanda Wedecka somewhere around 1969-1970. I became friends with her son, Stanisław, at the art center, where we attended drawing lessons to prepare us for the entrance exams to the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Mrs. Wanda lived in an art studio in the attic of a tall building on Świerczewskiego Street, now Solidarności Avenue. There was a wonderful smell of fresh paint everywhere, and heaps of paintings piled up all around. Flower paintings. This was the world I aspired to, and here someone simply lived in it.","wanda_m8":"Mrs. Wanda was a beautiful woman with black hair and a piercing gaze from her hazel eyes. Such was the mother of my newly found friend. Warm, kind, very elegant but without creating distance. She was an excellent and highly sought-after painter. Her floral compositions could be seen in all the major galleries in Warsaw, and they often changed, as people practically hunted for them. It was great decorative painting. Large close-ups of flowers, leaves, carefully arranged by the artist, painted with broad strokes of the spatula. At that time, Mrs. Wanda painted exclusively with a spatula, and she was a master at it. I still have one of her spatulas to this day. She often used shades of violet, crimson, and deep red. But her paintings were not monochromatic. You could sense in them the steady hand of someone who knew exactly what she wanted to achieve—and she achieved it.","wanda_m9":"She was a very nice and friendly person. I liked coming to visit Stanisław because it was a different world, one that his mother had created. Her private life fascinated me. She was involved with the graphic designer Tadeusz Jodłowski, who would later become our professor at the Academy. Despite their close relationship, they never lived together. Mr. Tadeusz had an identical studio in the same building, on the same floor, but you entered it through a different staircase. They never broke down the door that connected their studios. They never even made a small window to talk through. But they felt each other through the wall. They heard each other. They met every day. Even when they later moved to large studios on Bernardyńska Street, she occupied the top floor of one skyscraper, and he had an identical studio in the neighboring one. They lived in such symbiosis until Mrs. Wanda’s death. This was, for me, an unrivaled example of love—something that made her an extraordinary person, a Human with a capital H."}
