{"destiny":"Destiny – A few years after Staśek’s death, while visiting his studio where Helga was living, I saw a large unfinished painting on the wall. Helga told me that it was Staśek’s last painting and that he had started to add something in the bottom right corner, but he didn’t manage to finish it. That’s when an idea came to me about how to complete the painting. I suggested to Helga that I could paint his portrait in the place of a few sketchy lines that Staśek had left. The shape he had sketched looked like a head, almost like a ghost. Helga was very willing to agree, and that’s how our joint painting—Staśek’s and mine—came to be. He is there, almost like his own spirit. I hope he didn’t mind this small intervention. And for me, it was, and still is, a great pleasure that we could, even without his knowing, create something together.\n\n—Rafał Dmochowski","portfolio1":"The last paintings of Stanislaw Maria Wedecki","portfolio2":"The last paintings of Maria Wedecka","portfolio3":"Graphics"}
