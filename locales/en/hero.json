{"descriptionStan":"Born in 1951 in Bydgoszcz, Stanisław Maria Wedecki spent his childhood and youth in Warsaw, absorbing the artistic atmosphere of his mother Wanda Wedecka's studio. After preparing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, he graduated in painting under Professor Jerzy Tchórzewski in 1976. In the early 1980s, he emigrated, living in Vienna and then Hamburg. His works, primarily from the 1980s and 1990s, reflect a unique style that blends surrealism and magical realism. Using pastel tones and dreamlike settings, his compositions often feature surreal animals, such as horses and peacocks, as well as whimsical human figures set in poetic landscapes. Stanisław participated in numerous exhibitions during his career, presenting his art both in Poland and abroad.\n\n","descriptionWanda":"Wanda Wedecka, born in 1919 in Homel, Belarus, belongs to the generation of artists whose careers developed in the challenging post-war years. She graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts in Toruń in 1951, studying under Tymon Niesiołowski. In the 1950s and 1960s, Wanda's work was characterized by urban landscapes with cubist forms and a dark, monochromatic palette. Over time, her compositions expanded to include abstract art and still lifes, particularly her signature floral works, which gained international recognition. Wanda exhibited her paintings extensively in the 1970s through the 1990s, with much success both in Poland and abroad.\n\n","hero1":"Explore Wanda's Artistic World","hero2":"Discover Stanislaw's Creative Journey"}
